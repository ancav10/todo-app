# Getting Started

- First, create a fork of the repo.
- Clone the repo to your local machine

## Preparing Your Local Environment for Development

Now that you have cloned the repository, run the following commands to set up the development environment.

```bash
yarn install
```

This will download and install all packages needed.

## Making Your Changes

Make your changes to the project. Commits are linted using precommit hooks, meaning that any code that raises linting error cannot be committed. In order to help avoid that, we recommend using an IDE or editor with an eslint plugin in order to streamline the development process. Plugins are available for all the popular editors. For more information see [ESLint Integrations](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/integrations)

## Committing Your Changes

FrontWings ToDo App commit messages must follow the [conventional commit format](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.2/)
